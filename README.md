# cookiecutter-server

A local development server to get live previews of cookiecutter templates

## Getting Started

To set up your local development environment, please use a fresh virtual environment, then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
    pip install -e .

You can now launch the server from the command line; try `cc_server --help`.

### Testing

We use `pytest` as test framework. To execute the tests, please run

    python setup.py test

To run the tests with coverage information, please use

    python setup.py testcov

and have a look at the `htmlcov` folder, after the tests are done.

### Distribution Package

To build a distribution package (wheel), please use

    python setup.py dist

this will clean up the build folder and then run the `bdist_wheel` command.
