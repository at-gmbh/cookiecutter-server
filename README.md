A local development server to get live previews of cookiecutter templates.

## Getting Started

...

## Contributing

To set up your local development environment, please use a fresh virtual environment, then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
    pip install -e .

You can now launch the server from the command line; try `cc_server --help`.

We use `pytest` as test framework. To execute the tests, please run

    python setup.py test

To build a distribution package (wheel), please use

    python setup.py dist

this will clean up the build folder and then run the `bdist_wheel` command.

Before contributing code, please set up the pre-commit hooks to reduce errors and ensure consistency

    pip install -U pre-commit
    pre-commit install

### PyPI Release

This project is released on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter-server/). Most of the tedious steps that are required to test & publish your release are automated by [CI pipelines](https://github.com/at-gmbh/cookiecutter-server/actions). All you have to do is to write your code and when the time comes to make a release, please follow these steps:

* update the program version in [`src/cc_server/version.py`](./src/cc_server/version.py)
* write a summary of your changes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md)
* add a tag on the master branch with the new version number preceded by the letter `v`, e.g. for version 1.0.0 the tag would be `v1.0.0`. To tag the head of the current branch, use `git tag v1.0.0`
* push your changes to GitHub and don't forget to push the tag with `git push origin v1.0.0`
* now have a look at the [release pipeline](https://github.com/at-gmbh/cookiecutter-server/actions/workflows/release.yml); if it finishes without errors, you can find your release on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/cookiecutter-server/). Please verify that your release works as expected.
* Now for the live deployment on PyPI. To avoid mistakes, this is only triggered, when a release is published on GitHub first. Please have a look at the [Releases](https://github.com/at-gmbh/cookiecutter-server/releases) now; there should be a draft release with your version number (this was created by the CI pipeline which also made the TestPyPI release). Edit the draft release, copy the text you added to [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) into the description field and publish it.
* After you publish the release, the [deploy pipeline](https://github.com/at-gmbh/cookiecutter-server/actions/workflows/deploy.yml) is triggered on GitHub. It will publish the release directly to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter-server/) where everyone can enjoy your latest features.
